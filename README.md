A project for 41082 â€“ Introduction to Data Engineering, UTS, Autumn 2022

This project focusses on modelling school attendance rates against various contextual local factors such as average income, crime rates and socio-economic status. In this, two machine learning models are produced using MATLAB language, revealing the degree of correlation between attendance rates and chosen indicators to provide a foundation for future predictions.
